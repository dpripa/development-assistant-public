A professional toolkit for development and customer support of plugins and themes.

== Description ==
Development Assistant is a comprehensive toolkit designed to streamline the development process and enhance support capabilities within WordPress. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a novice WordPress user, this plugin provides essential functionalities to manage debugging, diagnose issues, and facilitate smoother development workflows.

** Features **
- **Debugging Made Easy:** Enable WP_DEBUG, WP_DEBUG_LOG, and WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY modes directly from the WordPress admin panel without the need to manually edit the wp-config.php file. Effortlessly toggle these settings to facilitate efficient debugging and error tracking.
- **Plugin Conflict Resolution:** Simplify the process of identifying and resolving plugin conflicts. Quickly compare the performance of active and inactive plugins, and temporarily disable or enable plugins to isolate issues without disrupting your entire plugin ecosystem.
- **SMTP Testing with MailHog:** Seamlessly integrate MailHog for SMTP testing purposes. Verify the functionality of email delivery within your WordPress environment, ensuring reliable communication with users and clients.
- **Download Plugins:** Download plugins directly from the WordPress admin panel's plugin view. Streamline your workflow by easily obtaining plugin files for offline storage, manual installation, or testing in other environments and sandboxes. This feature facilitates seamless testing of plugins in various environments, allowing for thorough evaluation and development iterations.
- **Reset:** Effortlessly undo any changes made by the plugin to restore your WordPress environment to its original state. This feature deletes all plugin settings and data from the database, resets debug constants to their pre-activation states, deletes the debug.log file (if it didn't exist before activation), and activates any temporarily deactivated plugins.
